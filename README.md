# Schematics of the Bondwell B310 and B310plus

After repairing several old Bondwell laptops, I began creating circuit diagrams for the device. The circuits for the voltage converters should be complete. I am quite far along with the logic circuits, but still have a long way to go.

The circuit may still contain errors, or some components may be missing. Please use at your own risk.
